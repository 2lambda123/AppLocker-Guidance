When setting up an event forwarding subscription, it is necessary to tell the subscription 
which events are desired for forwarding.  The following event query can be used within an 
event subscription to select the AppLocker Meta Events for forwarding:

<QueryList>
  <Query Id="0" Path="AppLocker">
    <Select Path="AppLocker">*[System[(Level=1  or Level=2 or Level=3)]]</Select>
  </Query>
</QueryList>
