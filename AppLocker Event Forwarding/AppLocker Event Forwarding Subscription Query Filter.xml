When setting up an event forwarding subscription, it is necessary to tell the subscription 
which events are desired for forwarding.  The following event query can be used within an 
event subscription to select only the AppLocker warning and error events for forwarding:

<QueryList>
  <Query Id="0" Path="Microsoft-Windows-AppLocker/EXE and DLL">
    <Select Path="Microsoft-Windows-AppLocker/EXE and DLL">*[System[Provider[@Name='Microsoft-Windows-AppLocker'] and (Level=1  or Level=2 or Level=3)]]</Select>
    <Select Path="Microsoft-Windows-AppLocker/MSI and Script">*[System[Provider[@Name='Microsoft-Windows-AppLocker'] and (Level=1  or Level=2 or Level=3)]]</Select>
  </Query>
